# sakthai-coding-error-handling

`sakthai-agent-v2` has a consistent failure philosophy: **errors the model can
react to are returned, not raised; external dependencies fail soft; bad input
fails fast.** Match the surface you're editing rather than reaching for a generic
try/except.

## When to use this skill

- Writing or editing a tool handler (`agent/tools.py`)
- Touching the agent loop's tool dispatch (`agent/loop.py`)
- Wiring external MCP servers (`mcp/manager.py`)
- Validating model/user input before doing work
- Deciding between raising, returning an error, or skipping

## Rule 1 — Surface tool errors to the model, don't crash the loop

`_execute_tool` wraps each handler and returns `(output, is_error)`; an exception
becomes an error *result*, not a crash. The MCP server mirrors this with
`isError: true` content. The loop feeds that back as a `tool_result` so the model
can recover (retry, pick another tool, or report).

```python
# loop dispatch — errors are reported, not raised
try:
    return tool.handler(args, store), False
except Exception as exc:        # noqa: BLE001 — surfaced back to the model
    logger.debug("Tool %r raised %s: %s", tool.name, type(exc).__name__, exc)
    return f"{type(exc).__name__}: {exc}", True
```

In a handler, prefer returning a clear, actionable message for *expected* failure
(e.g. "`{path}` is outside the allowed roots. Add it to `SAKTHAI_READ_ALLOW`")
rather than raising a bare exception — the message goes straight to the model.
This is the one place a broad `except Exception` (with `# noqa: BLE001`) is
correct; everywhere else, catch narrowly.

## Rule 2 — Fail soft on external dependencies

`connect_servers()` starts each external MCP server and, if one won't start,
**logs and skips it** — the run continues with the tools that did come up. Apply
the same to any optional/remote integration: degrade, don't abort. Tests rely on
this (a missing endpoint self-skips rather than failing — see the `integration`
marker in [[sakthai-coding-testing]]).

## Rule 3 — Fail fast on bad input

Validate and bound *before* expensive or irreversible work. The tool layer does
this: `_coerce_limit` clamps to `[1, _RECALL_LIMIT_MAX]`; `read_file` resolves and
checks the allowlist before opening; `run_command` checks `SAKTHAI_SHELL_ALLOW`
before spawning. Reject early with a specific reason.

```python
def _coerce_limit(raw: Any, default: int) -> int:
    try:
        limit = int(raw) if raw else default
    except (TypeError, ValueError):
        limit = default
    return max(1, min(limit, _RECALL_LIMIT_MAX))
```

## Rule 4 — Preserve context with `raise ... from`

When you do raise (in non-handler code — store, parsing, config), chain the cause
so the trail survives. `skills.py` does exactly this:

```python
try:
    front = yaml.safe_load(parts[1])
except yaml.YAMLError as exc:
    raise SkillParseError(f"{path}: invalid YAML — {exc}") from exc
```

Use a **specific exception type** with a message that says what failed and how to
fix it (path, key, expected vs actual). Define a domain exception
(`SkillParseError`, etc.) rather than raising bare `ValueError` where callers need
to distinguish it.

## Rule 5 — Partial failure in batch work

When processing many items (facts, servers, files), don't let one bad item abort
the batch — collect successes and failures separately and report both. This is
the same instinct as fail-soft, applied per-item.

## Choosing the strategy

| Situation | Strategy |
|-----------|----------|
| Tool handler hits an expected problem | **Return** an actionable error string |
| Tool handler hits an unexpected exception | Loop converts it to an `isError` result |
| Optional external server/endpoint down | **Fail soft** — log + skip, continue |
| Invalid model/user input | **Fail fast** — validate, clamp, reject early |
| Internal invariant broken (parse/config) | **Raise** a specific exception, `from exc` |

## Common pitfalls

1. **Don't let a tool raise out of the loop** — return `(msg, is_error)` /
   `isError`; the model can't recover from a crash.
2. **Don't swallow errors silently** — log at debug and surface a message;
   `except: pass` hides bugs.
3. **Don't use a broad `except Exception`** outside the deliberate
   loop/handler boundary — catch narrowly elsewhere.
4. **Don't `raise` without `from`** when re-wrapping — you lose the cause.
5. **Don't abort a batch on the first bad item** — track and report partial
   results.
