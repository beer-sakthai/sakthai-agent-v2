# Playwright IME Composition Validation

## Purpose

International text entry workflows often break because apps fire blur/enter handlers
before the browser finishes IME composition. This skill lets you actively probe those
edge cases with Playwright: simulate compositionstart, compositionupdate,
compositionend, and assert that committed text is delivered to your input / contenteditable
before blur or form submission.

## Prerequisites

1. Playwright installed: `npm install @playwright/test`
2. Browsers downloaded: `npx playwright install chromium`
3. Node.js >=18 with npm

## Core Workflow

1. Route to your target page.
2. Focus an IME-capable input/contenteditable.
3. Use Playwright keyboard dispatch plus custom `page.evaluate` to fire composition events.
4. Assert committed text before blur and after blur/save.

## Tool Calls

- `page.goto(url)`
- `page.locator("selector").focus()`
- `page.keyboard.down(key)` / `page.keyboard.up(key)`
- `page.evaluate(fn)` to dispatch `CompositionEvent` and inspect `document.activeElement`
- `page.screenshot()` to capture failure artifacts without network dependency

## Minimal Proof of Concept (POC)

Write `tests/ime-composition.spec.ts`:

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('composed Japanese text survives blur', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.setContent(
    `<input id="name" /><div id="out"></div><button id="save">Save</button>`
  );
  const input = page.locator('#name');
  const out = page.locator('#out');
  const save = page.locator('#save');

  await input.focus();
  await page.evaluate(() => {
    const el = document.getElementById('name') as HTMLInputElement;
    el.value = '';
    el.dispatchEvent(new CompositionEvent('compositionstart', { data: 'にほん' }));
    el.dispatchEvent(new CompositionEvent('compositionupdate', { data: 'にほん' }));
    el.value = '日本';
    el.dispatchEvent(new CompositionEvent('compositionend', { data: '日本' }));
    el.dispatchEvent(new Event('input', { bubbles: true }));
    el.dispatchEvent(new Event('change', { bubbles: true }));
  });

  await expect(input).toHaveValue('日本');
  await save.click();
  await expect(out).toHaveText('saved:日本');
});
```

Run it offline against the inline HTML:

```bash
npx playwright test tests/ime-composition.spec.ts
```

## Common Pitfalls

- **Over-reliance on `type()`**: `page.keyboard.type()` may not faithfully emit
  `compositionstart/update/end`. Use `page.evaluate()` to inject events.
- **Blur races**: Some frameworks blur on mousedown. `blur()` on a composed input
  may yield empty `value`. Always assert input value before blurring.
- **contenteditable differences**: Use `document.execCommand('insertText')` inside
  `page.evaluate()` or set `innerText` after compositionend instead of setting `value`.
- **Permissive Shadow DOM**: If the input is in Shadow DOM, use locator's `evaluate`
  on the scoped root, not the document.
- **Emoji input on Windows**: Some tools expose grapheme clusters differently. Compare
  lengths after `Array.from(text).length`, not `text.length`.

## Verification / Done Criteria

A healthy run:

1. The input field reports committed text (`日本`) immediately after compositionend.
2. Clicking a save button preserves committed text and the recorded output matches.
3. In CI, the test passes without coordinators, accessibility-tree polling, or flaky waits.
4. A failing scenario (compositionend + immediate blur, no input commit) should show
   `value == ''`, confirming the test actually catches composition races.
