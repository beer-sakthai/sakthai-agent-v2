"""Connect to configured MCP servers and expose their tools to the agent.

:func:`connect_servers` is a context manager: it starts each server (failing
soft — a server that won't start is logged and skipped), yields the merged list
of their tools (namespaced ``<server>__<tool>`` so they can't clash with the
built-ins or each other), and closes every client on exit. Run the agent loop
*inside* the ``with`` so the subprocesses stay alive while their tools are called:

    with connect_servers() as mcp_tools:
        run_agent(task, tools=(*BUILTIN_TOOLS, *mcp_tools))
