# SaaS Growth Efficiency Metrics

## Why this skill
Growth at any cost leaves cash on the table and scares investors. These metrics compress growth, spend, and profitability into single scores that force trade-off clarity. They work as a quarterly board report and as an operational warning system.

---

## Core Metrics and Formulas

### 1. Burn Multiple
Measures how much cash you burn to generate $1 of ARR growth.

```
Burn Multiple = Net Burn (period) / Net New ARR (period)
```

**Net Burn** = Total cash operating outflow (sum of S&M, R&D, G&A) minus any net cash from operations. Use the "Net Burn" from your P&L or cash flow statement.

**Net New ARR** = Ending ARR − Starting ARR (includes new, expansion, and churn-adjusted movement).

**What it means:**
- < 1.0: Elite efficiency (Bessemer standard)
- 1.0–1.5: Efficient growth, healthy
- 1.5–2.0: Acceptable if outperforming on retention/operating leverage
- > 2.0: Danger zone; capital is being converted to growth at an expensive rate

**Time window:** quarterly or annual. Always match Net Burn and ARR change to the same period.

---

### 2. Magic Number (Sales Efficiency)
Measures how efficiently S&M spend generates ARR, with a lag for customer decision cycles.

```
Magic Number = Net New ARR (quarter) / S&M Spend (prior quarter)
```

Use prior-quarter S&M because revenue from that spend often closes in the following quarter.

**Benchmarks:**
- < 0.7: Poor sales efficiency; rethink channel mix, ICP, or ICP fit
- 0.7–1.0: Below median; improve conversion or raise ACV
- > 1.0: Efficient; good ARR generation per dollar invested

Do NOT use if ARR growth is >50% quarter-over-quarter because the denominator is stale; discount the number.

---

### 3. Bessemer Efficiency Score
A normalized scoring system from 0–25+ that combines Margin Score (based on FCF margin or Rule of 40) and Growth Score (ARR growth %).

```
Efficiency Score = (FCF Margin × 1.5) + ARR Growth %

where FCF Margin = FCF / ARR
```

Simplified variant if you don’t have clean FCF:

```
Efficiency Score = (Gross Margin % × 1.5) + ARR Growth %
```

**Benchmarks (Bessemer):**
- 0–4: Struggling
- 4–16: On the fence
- 16–24: Good
- 25+: Elite

The ×1.5 weight on margin reflects the capital-efficiency premium investors place on profitability over pure growth.

---

### 4. Rule of 40
The classic SaaS health check: growth rate + profit margin should sum to ≥ 40%.

```
Rule of 40 % = ARR Growth % + EBITDA Margin %
```

If EBITDA margin is negative, use `+ (FCF Margin %)` or `+ (Gross Margin % − Opex % of ARR)`.

**Benchmarks:**
- 40–60: Healthy mid-growth
- 60–80: Strong, private flagship
- 80+: Exceptional (rare, often PE-backed or dominated)
- < 40 at scale (> $50M ARR): Warning sign; debate whether growth or margin is the constraint

Use this as the **board North Star** because it is intuitive and investor-standard.

---

### 5. ROSE — Revenue Operating Spend Efficiency
A forward-looking efficiency metric that compares net new ARR to total operating spend (not just sales).

```
ROSE = Net New ARR (quarter) / Total Opex (quarter)
```

Total Opex = S&M + R&D + G&A (all operating expenses).

**Benchmarks:**
- 0.15–0.25: Typical for growth-stage SaaS
- > 0.25: Exceptional
- < 0.10: Heavy burn relative to growth

ROSE is most useful when tracking whether each incremental hire or office expansion translates into proportional ARR growth.

---

## Step-by-Step Diagnostic Workflow

### 1. Pull aligned quarterly data
Collect:
- Starting ARR, Ending ARR, Net New ARR
- Net Burn (or total Opex)
- Prior-quarter S&M
- Gross Margin %, FCF (if available)
- R&D and G&A split

### 2. Compute the scorecard
Use the formulas above. Put all five metrics in a single table for trend analysis (rolling 4 quarters).

### 3. Classify the business phase
Use Burn Multiple + Rule of 40 to label the stage:

| Label | Burn Multiple | Rule of 40 | Typical ARR | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Efficient Growth | < 1.0 | 40–60+ | $1M–$30M | Accelerate top-of-funnel and expansion |
| Balanced Growth | 1.0–1.8 | 30–50 | $5M–$50M | Optimize CAC payback; avoid headcount bloat |
| Burn-Heavy Growth | > 1.8 | < 30 | < $10M or restructuring | Rationalize S&M, tighten hiring, fix pricing |
| Profitability Turn | Deteriorating | > 60+ | > $30M | Harvest value, prepare exit or strong balance sheet |

### 4. Drill into levers
If Burn Multiple > 1.5:
- Diagnose whether the problem is S&M efficiency (low Magic Number) or unit economics (low Gross Margin).
- If Magic Number is also low: renegotiate channel contracts, refine ICP, increase price, reduce free trial length, or cut low-converting campaigns.
- If Magic Number is fine but Gross Margin is low: fix hosting costs, support costs, or packaging to raise Gross Margin.

If Rule of 40 < 30 but ARR growth > 50%:
- You are in "growth at all costs." Decide explicitly whether investors support this profile or if you must raise Gross Margin to ≥ 70%+.

### 5. Set rolling targets
For the next quarter, assign one primary efficiency target per metric:
- "Cut Burn Multiple from 1.9 to 1.4 by reducing S&M spend by 15% and raising Average ACV by 10%"
- "Raise Magic Number from 0.8 to 1.0 by shifting $100K from LinkedIn to SEO/content"
- "Increase Gross Margin from 72% to 78% by migrating 60% of workloads to reserved infrastructure"

## Formulas cheat sheet

```
Burn Multiple            = Net Burn / Net New ARR
Magic Number             = Net New ARR (this quarter) / S&M (prior quarter)
Bessemer Efficiency      = (FCF Margin % × 1.5) + ARR Growth %
Rule of 40               = ARR Growth % + EBITDA Margin %
ROSE                     = Net New ARR / Total Opex
LTV:CAC                  = (CM3 or Gross Margin contribution per customer × expected lifetime) / CAC
CAC Payback (months)     = CAC / (CM3 per customer per month)
```

---

## Pitfalls

1. **Mixing time windows.** Burn Multiple requires Net Burn and Net New ARR from the same period. Magic Number intentionally uses prior-quarter S&M; do not confuse the two.
2. **Ignoring FCF vs. net burn.** Magic Number should use cash-basis S&M, not accrual. If S&M spend is paid out over time, use actual cash paid.
3. **Using ARR growth in hypergrowth.** If ARR growth is >60% quarterly, Magic Number and Burn Multiple are noisy. Shift focus to ROSE and Gross Margin trajectory.
4. **Treating Rule of 40 as a ceiling.** It is a floor. Strong private companies aim for 60+ during growth and 80+ before exit or IPO.
5. **Using blended Gross Margin.** If you sell to SMB, Mid-Market, and Enterprise, compute Gross Margin by segment. A 70% blended margin with 85% Enterprise and 60% SMB hides SMB margin problems.
6. **Leveraging ROSE without segmenting.** Moving headcount from R&D to S&M can improve ROSE temporarily while degrading product quality and long-term retention.
7. **Confusing CAC with S&M.** CAC includes sales compensation, tools, and overhead. S&M alone is a proxy, not the truth, especially in channel-led motions.

## Verification step

**The Quarterly Scorecard Reconciliation:**
For each metric, compute it two ways:
- **Top-down from P&L/CMS billing data** (ARR, Net Burn)
- **Bottom-up from campaign + headcount + cost data** (S&M, R&D, G&A)

If top-down and bottom-up differ by > 10%, find the reconciling item. Common culprits: capitalized S&M, refunds, contra-revenue, or deferred revenue timing. Fix the data model before using the metric for a decision.

**The Absurdity Check:**
If your Burn Multiple is < 0.5 while ARR growth is > 30%, verify that Net Burn is truly net (include stock-based expense and cash tied up in inventory or receivables if applicable). An unrealistically low Burn Multiple usually means SBC or working capital is being hidden.

## Integration with other skills

- **gtm-channel-mix-economics** — Use Magic Number to validate channel-mix decisions and force-budget high-efficiency channels.
- **saas-retention-metrics** — Pair NRR with Burn Multiple; a 110%+ NRR with a 1.8+ Burn Multiple may still be efficient if the company is pre-product-market-fit.
- **ecommerce-unit-economics** — Convert S&M to CAC and use CM3% instead of Gross Margin for blended DTC/PLG models.
- **b2b-pipeline-math-mql-to-close** — Use pipeline conversion data to forecast Net New ARR with confidence intervals before committing to S&M burn multiples.
- **saas-pricing-architecture** — Raise ACV immediately impacts Magic Number and Burn Multiple by increasing Net New ARR without new channel spend.
