# CS Capacity Modeling & Engagement-Tier Design

The "$2M ARR per CSM" benchmark is a starting rumor, not an answer. Real CS capacity depends on **what you ask the CSM to do**, which varies wildly by segment. This skill builds a bottom-up workload model, segments accounts into engagement tiers, and links CSM headcount to your NRR target without over-hiring orburning out the team.

## When to use

Trigger this skill when you:
- Are scaling past **~$10M ARR with a real CS team** or hiring your first few CSMs.
- See NRR regressing and suspect **coverage gaps** (not product problems).
- Need to defend a **CS budget** (should be ~5–15% of ARR; <10% past $100M ARR per GASP) to CFO/board.
- Are deciding between **dedicated, pooled, or digital CS** coverage for a new product line or segment.

## Core principle

**Capacity = time, not ARR.** Bottom-up workload always beats top-down revenue per CSM.

```
Annual CSM capacity hours       ≈ 1,600 (after PTO, admin, internal meetings — ~60% utilization on customers)
Touchpoints per account per year (varies by tier — see step 3)
Hours per touchpoint             (varies by touchpoint type — see step 4)
Accounts per CSM                 = Annual capacity hours / Σ(hours per touchpoint × frequency)
```

## Step-by-step workflow

### Step 1 — Segment your book

Sort every account into **3 to 5 segments**, typically:
- **Strategic / Enterprise** — top ~5–10% by ARR, complex, executive sponsorship.
- **Mid-Market** — meaningful ARR, named buyer, multi-stakeholder.
- **SMB / Long-Tail** — high volume, low ARR per account, often self-serve.
- *(Optional)* New logo onboarding pool, at-risk save pool, expansion-only pools.

Use **ARR, ACV, product complexity, number of stakeholders, and contract length** — not just ARR — as segmentation signals.

### Step 2 — Set the NRR target by segment
Different tiers carry different NRR potential:
| Segment | Typical NRR range | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Strategic | 115–130% | Expansion-heavy, multi-product, exec relationships |
| Mid-Market | 105–115% | Moderate expansion, decent retention |
| SMB | 95–110% | Logo churn dominant, expansion thin |

Sum `(Segment ARR × Segment NRR target) / Total ARR = Blended NRR target`. If the math is below your goal, you need **either more coverage or higher-expansion segments**.

### Step 3 — Assign engagement tier per segment

| Tier | Who does the work | Typical trigger | Annual touchpoints per account |
|---|---|---|---|
| **High-Touch** | Dedicated named CSM | Enterprise, regulated, >$XXk ACV, multi-product | 24–40 (QBRs, EBRs, executive sync, onboarding, health reviews) |
| **Low-Touch** | CSM shared across accounts | Mid-Market, single product, single stakeholder | 6–12 (onboarding, 1–2 check-ins, renewal QBR) |
| **Tech-Touch** | Automated via playbook + pooled CSM on-demand | SMB, PLG signups, sub-$Xk ACV | 2–4 (automated emails, in-app nudges, optional human) |

Rule of thumb: **Strategic = high-touch ~100%**, **Mid-Market = ~70% low-touch + 30% high-touch**, **SMB = tech-touch ~95%**.

### Step 4 — Build the bottom-up capacity model

For each engagement tier, list every touchpoint type and assign:
```
touchpoint_hours = (number_per_year × hours_per_touch)
```

Example (High-Touch):
- Onboarding (40 hrs × 1/yr) = 40
- Quarterly Business Review (8 hrs × 4/yr) = 32
- Executive Business Review (4 hrs × 1/yr) = 4
- Health/risk reviews (2 hrs × 4/yr) = 8
- Expansion conversations (6 hrs × 2/yr) = 12
- Renewal (10 hrs × 1/yr) = 10
- Ad-hoc / Slack (3 hrs × 12/yr) = 36
- **Total = ~142 hours per account per year**

Example (Tech-Touch):
- Automated emails (0 hr human)
- Onboarding drip (1 hr pooled × 1/yr) = 1
- Quarterly automated check-in (0 hr human)
- Optional human on-demand (0.5 hr pooled × 1/yr) = 0.5
- **Total ≈ 1.5 hours per account per year**

### Step 5 — Solve for CSM headcount

```
Annual_customer_facing_hours_per_CSM ≈ 1,600 (60% utilization)

Required_CSM_FTEs = Σ [ accounts_in_tier × hours_per_account_per_year ] / 1,600

Add 15–25% for managers, Onboarding Specialists (often split role), and CS Ops.
```

Worked example (mid-stage SaaS, $30M ARR):
- 20 Strategic × 142 hrs = 2,840 hrs
- 150 Mid-Market × 45 hrs (mid-touch assumption) = 6,750 hrs
- 800 SMB × 1.5 hrs = 1,200 hrs
- **Total = 10,790 customer-facing hours ÷ 1,600 = 6.7 CSM FTEs** → hire 8 (with managers/onboarding).

Compare this to the lazy rule-of-thumb: $30M ARR / $2M per CSM = **15 CSMs**. Bottom-up says you really need 8. The "missing" CSMs are doing digital plays and have no business being hired as humans.

### Step 6 — Pressure-test against NRR

- **If actual NRR is below target**, capacity model says: either add CSMs to the segment driving the gap, **or** move accounts to a higher tier (cheap), **or** automate touchpoints to free CSM time for expansion.
- **If CS cost-to-ARR** is >15% past $30M ARR, you're over-covering. Shift accounts to a lower tier.
- **If CSMs are churning/quitting**, hours per account are wrong, not the headcount total.

## Formulas and benchmarks

| Metric | Formula | Healthy range |
|---|---|---|
| CS cost / ARR | (CS salaries + tools + overhead) ÷ ARR | 5–15%; <10% past $100M ARR |
| CSM accounts | per Step 4 | 8–25 enterprise; 40–80 mid-market; 200–500+ tech-touch (pooled) |
| Revenue per CSM | segmented ARR ÷ CSMs in that tier | <$1M = high-touch; $1–3M = mid-touch; $5M+ = tech-touch |
| Coverage ratio | (Accounts actually touched per quarter) ÷ (Total accounts) | >90% high-touch; >70% mid-touch; 100% tech-touch (digital) |
| Touchpoint utilization | CSM customer-facing hours ÷ total available | 55–65% sustainable |

## Pitfalls

- **Top-down ARR-per-CSM thinking** hides workload differences. A $500k enterprise account and ten $50k SMBs aren't the same workload.
- **Treating QBRs as 2 hours.** They're 6–10 if done well. If 2, you're not really doing QBRs.
- **Ignoring onboarding** in the model. Onboarding is the single biggest workload spike and the period you lose the most logos.
- **Hire-then-segment.** Always segment first. Otherwise you build capacity for the wrong book.
- **CSM ≠ Account Manager × Sales.** CSMs who carry hard quotas make *retention* worse. Expansion quota yes; net-new logo hard quota no.
- **Forgetting CS Ops.** A CS Ops person can lift CSM utilization by 10–15 points (better tooling, playbook automation, data quality).

## Verification step

After modeling:
1. **Sanity check CS cost / ARR** against the 5–15% benchmark — flag outliers.
2. **Cross-check with actual quarterly touchpoint logs.** Are CSMs really doing 1.5x the volume you modeled? If yes, model is wrong; if no, you have slack to absorb growth before next hire.
3. **Re-run the same model every 6 months** with actual ARR mix, churn, and expansion to detect coverage drift before NRR moves.
4. **One week shadow-audit:** pick 3 CSMs, log every interaction. Compare to the hours-per-touchpoint assumptions. The largest gap is your next fix.
