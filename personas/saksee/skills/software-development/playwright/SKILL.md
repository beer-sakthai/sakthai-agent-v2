# Playwright Automation

## Overview
Guidelines for using Playwright via Node.js in the Hermes environment.

## Runtime: LOCAL on the host (this profile, since 2026-06-20)
This profile now uses `terminal.backend: local` — your shell runs **directly on
the host** (a WSL2 box with **WSLg**, `DISPLAY=:0`), not in the Modal sandbox.
That means:
- You can see the **host filesystem** directly — e.g. `~/tmp/pw-poc/`. No need to
  clone into `/tmp`; just `cd` to the real project path.
- **Real Google Chrome is installed** (`/usr/bin/google-chrome`) and you can run
  **headed** so the window shows up on the laptop:
  ```js
  const { chromium } = require('playwright');
  const browser = await chromium.launch({ channel: 'chrome', headless: false });
  ```
  Verified: a headed Chrome window opened on the host via Saksee. For
  unattended/CI runs, headless is still fine.
- Host Node is v24; host browsers cache is `~/.cache/ms-playwright`.

### Signed-in Chrome (persistent profile)
To act as a **logged-in** user (Google, etc.), do NOT use `launch()` — it starts
logged out every time. Use a **persistent profile** so cookies survive between
runs:
```js
const { chromium } = require('playwright');
const ctx = await chromium.launchPersistentContext('/home/sakthai/.pw-chrome-profile', {
  channel: 'chrome', headless: false, viewport: null,
  args: ['--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled'],
  ignoreDefaultArgs: ['--enable-automation'],
});
const page = ctx.pages()[0] || await ctx.newPage();
// ... already signed in; do work ...
await ctx.close();
```
- The profile dir `/home/sakthai/.pw-chrome-profile` is signed in **once by the
  user** via `~/tmp/pw-poc/signin-chrome.js` (a visible window where they enter
  credentials by hand — never script-type passwords). After that, every run that
  points at the same dir is already logged in.
- Helper to reuse it: `node ~/tmp/pw-poc/open-signed-in.js [url]`.
- **Only one Chrome can hold the profile at a time** — don't run two scripts
  against it concurrently (profile lock). Close one before starting another.

The Modal-sandbox notes below apply only if this profile is switched back to
`backend: modal`.

## Sandbox runtime (only if backend: modal)
In the Modal sandbox (`nikolaik/python-nodejs:python3.11-nodejs20`, Node 20):
- **No display** — always launch `headless: true`.
- **Ephemeral container** — browsers install to `/root/.cache/ms-playwright` and
  persist within a session, but a fresh session needs the bootstrap again.
- **No persistent workspace, no pre-existing project.** Don't hunt for a project
  dir like `/home/...`, `/home/pn`, or `/home/saas` — they don't exist in the
  sandbox. To work on an existing repo, **`git clone` it into `/tmp` first**; to
  start fresh, create the project under `/tmp`.
- **One-shot bootstrap** (run once per session, before the first launch):
  ```bash
  cd /tmp && npm init -y >/dev/null 2>&1 && npm i playwright@1.61.0 >/dev/null 2>&1
  npx -y playwright@1.61.0 install --with-deps chromium
  ```
  `--with-deps` is required — without it Chromium fails with missing `.so` errors.
- **Alternate headless shell** — in some sandbox configurations the default Chromium binary is not loadable. Use the Playwright headless shell instead:
  ```bash
  python -m playwright install chromium-headless-shell
  ```
  The binary lands under `~/.cache/ms-playwright/chromium_headless_shell-<ver>/chrome-headless-shell-linux64`. If launch fails with `EACCES`, run `chmod +x` on that binary. Launch with:
  ```js
  browser = await chromium.launch({
    headless: true,
    executablePath: '/root/.cache/ms-playwright/chromium_headless_shell-1223/chrome-headless-shell-linux64'
  });
  ```

### Preferred default on this host

Use **Node 20** and the **npm-installed `playwright` package**. Playwright 1.60
(currently installed) is confirmed working here after the browser + system-lib
bootstrap completes. Even if a project `.venv` exists, use Node unless the
user explicitly wants Python.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (npm) must be available (checked via `which npm`).

## Installation
```bash
npm install -D playwright
# After install, fetch browsers (use --with-deps in the sandbox)
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

## Prerequisites (Linux/WSL)
The browsers need a set of system libraries. On Debian‑based systems install them with:
```
apt-get install -y libnspr4 libnss3 libatk-bridge2.0-0 libatk1.0-0 libxshmfence1 libdrm2 libgbm1 libxss1 libxrender1
```
These packages were required for the Chrome headless shell.

## Running a script
1. Save your script to a file, e.g. `script.js`.
2. Execute it with:
   ```bash
   node script.js
   ```
   or, for Playwright test files, use:
   ```bash
   npx playwright test
   ```

## Recommended config
Use TypeScript by default. The template `templates/playwright.config.ts` includes
HTML reporter, one project, and sensible retry/screenshot/video settings.
Create it with:
```bash
cp ~/.hermes/profiles/sakthai/skills/software-development/playwright/templates/playwright.config.ts ./playwright.config.ts
```

## Running tests
```bash
# Run suite with list + html reporters
npx playwright test --reporter=list,html
```

```bash
# For CI-style artifacts (JUnit + JSON) explicitly:
npx playwright test --reporter=list,html,junit,json --junit=test-results/junit.xml --json=test-results/results.json
```
HTML report: `playwright-report/index.html`

## Test project structure
- `tests/*.spec.ts` — Playwright test files
- `playwright-report/` — HTML report directory
- `test-results/` — screenshots, videos, error context per failing test

## Python alternative (verified)
Playwright also works from Python in this sandbox. Use the async API:
```bash
python3 -m pip install playwright
playwright install --with-deps chromium
```
Reference snippet:
```python
import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

async def main():
    async with async_playwright() as p:
        browser = await p.chromium.launch(headless=True)
        page = await browser.new_page()
        await page.goto("https://example.com")
        print("Title:", await page.title())
        await browser.close()

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Profiles boundary
When scripts write a new skill, the runtime defaults to `cross_profile: false` for paths under `/home/sakthai/.hermes/`. For the cross-profile playwright-minute learner, set `cross_profile: true` explicitly.

## Zero-cost QA deliverables
To produce full Playwright test suites, CI-ready configs, and deliverable
reports at **no monetary cost**:
1. Use the project-local `npx playwright test` runner (open-source).
2. Store results as HTML report (`playwright-report/`), JUnit XML
   (`test-results/junit.xml`), and JSON (`test-results/results.json`).
3. CI: GitHub Actions free runners with `actions/upload-artifact@v4` to
   preserve reports for 14 days.
4. Target the user's local app when available (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`);
   fall back to public sites only when no local server exists.
5. Verify each run before claiming "green"; do not substitute fabricated or
   placeholder test output.

## Targeting local apps
When a local server is available:
- Set `baseURL` in `playwright.config.ts` to the local origin.
- Ensure the server is running and healthy before kicking off the suite
  (curl `/health`, `/api/...`, or `page.goto('/')` smoke probe).
- Prefer API-level requests (`request.get('/api/...')`) for fast stable
  assertions; avoid brittle DOM structure checks on SPAs until hydration
  is confirmed.

## Visual regression
- Snapshots live under `tests/<file>-spec.ts-snapshots/`.
- First run: `UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1 npx playwright test <suite>` to capture
  baselines.
- Use `maxDiffPixels` tolerance on hosted apps whose rendering varies.
- Handle SPAs: wait for `#root` / app container with `state: 'attached'`
  before screenshot. `page.waitForSelector('#root', { state: 'attached' })`.

## Accessibility & matcher caveats
- `toHaveCountGreaterThan(n)` is **not** a built-in Playwright matcher.
  Use: `await expect(await locator.count()).toBeGreaterThan(n)`.
- Headless environments may skip geolocation tests: guard with
  `if (coords.unsupported || coords.error) test.skip();`.

## Network timing on local apps
- `waitUntil: 'networkidle'` often times out on local apps with external
  resources (fonts, analytics). Use `domcontentloaded` or rely on
  `page.waitForSelector(...)` for readiness.
- Increase timeouts generously for local apps: `navigationTimeout: 60000`,
  `actionTimeout: 30000`.

## Report generation
- `html` reporter alone does not guarantee `junit.xml` / `results.json`.
- Explicitly pass reporters: `--reporter=html,junit,json` **and** set
  `outputDir: 'test-results/'` in config, **or** pass `--junit=... --json=...`
  on the CLI.
- In CI, always `if: always()` the artifact upload steps so reports appear
  even when the suite fails.

## Test recording baseline
Use the companion template `templates/demo.spec.ts` as a starting point for:
- title / text assertions
- API endpoint validation
- click + state-change assertions
