## 🚀 Phases — Product & Monetization (Continued)

### Phase 6 — Detailed Product & Market Analysis (Pivoted 2026-07-02)

*Goal: To ensure the agent is ready for any business type, including digital marketing, we will perform a more detailed analysis before building.*

#### Part A: Market & Problem Discovery

  - 1. Digital Marketing Agency
  - 1. Local Service Business
  - 1. Student / Researcher
  - 1. E-commerce Store
  - 1. Content Creator / Solopreneur
- [x] For each archetype, list 5-10 common, repetitive, information-based problems they face. — 2026-07-02

#### Part B: Agent Capability & Gap Analysis

- [x] Audit the Sak-Family-Agent's current tools (`learn`, `recall`, `search`, etc.) and skills. — 2026-07-02
- [ ] Create a map: which existing tools/skills can solve which problems from Part A? *(In Progress)*
  - **1. Digital Marketing Agency**
    - **Problem:** Repetitive Content Creation & Trend-Chasing.
      - **Capability:** SakSit (content) + SakSee (research).
      - **Gap:** Needs a reliable tool to programmatically identify trending audio/formats on platforms like TikTok.
    - **Problem:** Repetitive Reporting & Simple Analysis.
      - **Capability:** SakTan (ops) + SakSee (data gathering).
      - **Gap:** Direct API access to social media platforms (e.g., via Composio) would be more robust than screen-scraping.
    - **Problem:** Repetitive Client Communication.
      - **Capability:** SakTan (ops).
      - **Tools:** `send_telegram_message`, `learn`/`recall`.
      - **Gap:** Needs integration with email or a project management system to have real-time project status.
    - **Problem:** Repetitive Market & Influencer Research.
      - **Capability:** SakSee (web browsing).
      - **Gap:** Needs a more structured way to filter and score potential influencers beyond manual browsing.
- [ ] Identify capability gaps: what new skills or tools would be needed to be effective for these businesses?

#### Part C: MVP Definition & Strategy

- [ ] Based on the analysis, select the single most promising combination of (Business Archetype + Solvable Problem).
- [ ] Define a highly specific Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for this combination.
- [ ] Outline a low-risk monetization strategy for this MVP.

## 🔑 Key Principles for This Work

1. **Plan first, act second.** Update this PLAN.md before making edits.
2. **Surgical edits.** Change only what the task needs; preserve surrounding style.
3. **One persona at a time.** Finish and verify before moving to the next.
4. **No duplication.** Shared content (Charge, Principles, Operating Contract)
   lives in root `SOUL.md` — persona SOULs are lean and persona-specific.
5. **Protect Beer first.** No-cost, low-risk solutions always preferred.
