# sakthai-agent-v2 — roadmap

Living task list. Work top-to-bottom; check off with a dated one-line note when done.

## Phase 0 — Quality cleanup (from review cons)
- [x] Make brittle CLI test assertions robust (assert on stable tokens / exit
      codes, not fragile full-string output) — 2026-06-15: shifted mutating-command
      tests to store/file side-effect checks; dropped count/spacing-coupled output
- [x] Add a smoke test for dashboard/app.py (import + render the data path with
      a fake store) or document why it stays excluded — 2026-06-15: importorskip-
      guarded smoke test exercises the figure builders via stubbed st (5 tests,
      pass with [dashboard] extra, skip otherwise); documented the coverage omit
- [x] Depth pass: targeted correctness tests for memory/store.py migrations and
      the agent loop's stop/iteration logic — 2026-06-15: test_store_migrations.py
      (fresh→v3, idempotent reopen, legacy facts-only + confidence backfill) and
      loop cases (terminal max_tokens, unexpected stop, pause_turn, deadline trip)

## Phase 1 — Runtime plugin foundation (use ANY MCP / skill, no manual wiring)
- [x] Dynamic tool registry: merge builtin + runtime tools; make tool lookup
      registry-driven (agent/tools.py, new agent/registry.py) — 2026-06-15: added
      ToolRegistry (get/schemas/with_tools, last-wins merge); routed loop dispatch
      through it, fixing a latent bug where injected tools were advertised but not
      dispatchable. 178 tests.
- [x] MCP client (sakthai/mcp/client.py): spawn an external MCP server over
      stdio, initialize, tools/list, tools/call; reuse the JSON-RPC shapes from
      mcp/server.py; graceful failure (log + continue) — 2026-06-15: StdioMCPClient
      with select-timeout reads, as_tools(prefix=) wrapping, MCPClientError/
      MCPToolError fail-soft; 6 e2e tests vs the real server (184 passed)
- [x] Parse mcpServers manifests ({command,args,env}) from gemini-extension.json
      / .mcp.json (extend extensions/install discovery beyond names) — 2026-06-15:
      mcp/servers.py (MCPServerSpec, parse_mcp_servers, load_server_specs from
      ~/.sakthai/mcp.json + extension manifests, mcp.json wins). 192 passed.
- [x] Wire MCP-client tools into run_agent: load configured servers, convert
      their schemas to Tool objects, merge into the loop, route calls back —
      2026-06-15: mcp/manager.connect_servers (fail-soft, <server>__ namespacing,
      cleanup); proven e2e — an agent run dispatches sk__learn to an external MCP
      subprocess which writes to its own DB. 196 passed.
- [x] Skill injection: render selected SKILL.md bodies into the system prompt
      (loop._build_system + skills.render_skills_prompt_block); collect from
      ~/.sakthai/extensions too — 2026-06-15: render_skills_prompt_block +
      default_skill_roots (bundled+library+extensions); run_agent skills= and
      `sakthai run --with-skills`; injection verified in the system prompt. 203
      passed. **Phase 1 complete.**
- [x] CLI + config: auto-load all configured servers from ~/.sakthai/mcp.json so
      it works with zero flags; `--no-mcp` to opt out — 2026-06-15: `sakthai run`
      wraps run_agent in connect_servers() (no-op when none configured), merges
      external tools into the loop; 2 CLI tests (autoload + --no-mcp). 198 passed.
      (--with-skills lands with the skill-injection task below.)

## Phase 2 — Multi-runtime / local model (self-driving, no API key)
- [x] OpenAI-compatible / Ollama provider (the ~7 touches: config env, auth
      resolver, loop _detect/_build/_call_openai_compat, cli --provider choice) — 2026-06-15: added openai/ollama routing, _call_openai_compat, resolved credentials and base url, added cli choice, and verified via unit tests.
- [x] Run-under-another-AI: ship ready-to-paste MCP configs for Claude CLI and
      Gemini CLI; optionally expose the whole agent loop as one MCP tool so an
      external AI can call it — 2026-06-15: added run_agent_loop tool to BUILTIN_TOOLS and included integration configs in docs.
- [x] docs/plugins.md + docs/runtimes.md (connect any MCP/skill; run on Claude
      CLI / Gemini CLI / Ollama) — 2026-06-15: created docs/plugins.md and docs/runtimes.md.

## Phase 3 — Hardening
- [x] Hermetic tests for client (fake subprocess), registry, and the new
      provider (fake httpx) — keep the no-network rule — 2026-06-15: added provider and tool tests to tests/test_agent_loop.py.
- [x] Update CLAUDE.md / GEMINI.md / README / docs/architecture.md — 2026-06-15: updated documentation layers, commands, and options.

## Phase 4 — Concurrency & safety hardening (con areas resolved)
- [x] Concurrency Protection: enable SQLite WAL mode and secure write transactions via BEGIN IMMEDIATE — 2026-06-15: set BEGIN IMMEDIATE locks on all consolidation/import queries; WAL mode verified.
- [x] Indirect Recursion Safety: environment-based loop guard to prevent nested runs — 2026-06-15: added SAKTHAI_AGENT_ACTIVE environment flag and ValueError loop guard.
- [x] Context Token Pruning: prune intermediate loop history in run_agent_loop outputs — 2026-06-15: added prune_history parameter to the tool schema/handler.

## Phase 5 — Make it run (robustness + preflight)
Goal: the agent runs dependably — clean errors instead of raw tracebacks, a
zero-cost preflight, a hermetic proof the real CLI path runs, and resources that
survive a real install. One task at a time: local gate (ruff → format → mypy →
bandit → pytest) → commit → push to main → **wait for CI green** → next.

- [ ] Task 1 — Robust provider/store construction: wrap the google/openai branches
      of `_build_client` and the `MemoryStore()` init in `run_agent` so missing
      creds / FS errors raise a clean `AgentError`, not a raw traceback. Tests for
      forced-provider-no-creds and store-init failure. (sakthai/agent/loop.py,
      tests/test_agent_loop.py)
- [ ] Task 2 — Safe memory backup: `backup_memory()` raises a clear error when no
      DB exists yet; `sakthai memory backup` surfaces it as a ClickException, not a
      traceback. Test the no-DB path. (sakthai/memory/backup.py, sakthai/cli/memory.py,
      tests/test_memory_aux.py)
- [ ] Task 3 — Preflight `sakthai run --dry-run`: a `preflight()` helper resolves
      provider + credential source + model + tool count with **no API call**;
      `--dry-run` prints it and exits 0 when runnable. (sakthai/agent/loop.py,
      sakthai/cli/agent.py, tests/test_agent_loop.py, tests/test_cli.py)
- [ ] Task 4 — Hermetic end-to-end CLI smoke: drive the real `sakthai run` path via
      CliRunner with an injected fake client + temp SAKTHAI_HOME; assert a session
      log is written. No network, no cost. (tests/)
- [ ] Task 5 — Package bundled resources: ship skills/, library/, data/ in sdist +
      wheel (MANIFEST.in + setuptools) and make config.py resolve them for installed
      and editable layouts. Test resources resolve. (pyproject.toml, MANIFEST.in,
      sakthai/config.py, tests/)
